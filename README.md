# Voice Assistant

Have you ever felt that some of your daily tasks could be done by your computer- without your involvement? 
Like playing a soothing song for your relaxation or helping you with the meaning of "reconnaissance"? You may think I have Alexa/Siri for that- But how cool is it to make your own Virtual Assistant?
Seems interesting???

In this Repository I have created a Virtual Assiatnt of my own. Well, being a huge fan of the Office US, I named him Dwight!

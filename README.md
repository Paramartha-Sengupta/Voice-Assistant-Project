# Voice Assistant

Have you ever felt that some of your daily tasks could be done by your computer- without your involvement? 
Like playing a soothing song for your relaxation or helping you with the meaning of "reconnaissance"? You may think I have Alexa/Siri for that- But how cool is it to make your own Virtual Assistant? Like instead of being just a consumer, what if you could be the creator? 

Seems interesting???

In this Repository I have created a Virtual Assiatnt of my own. Well, being a huge fan of the Office US, I named him Dwight!

So the question arises, what can Dwight do for me?

1. Hey Dwight, can you search for an information from Wikipedia for me?

2. What about any song I say? Is that too possible?
